					<hr>
					<p>Three months after writing my very first “Hello World” program back on September 8th, 2024, I somehow found myself convincing my boss to let me take a shot at rebuilding the company’s outdated laboratory management system.</p>

					<p>What started as curiosity quickly turned into responsibility — before I knew it, the old system was gone, replaced with the one I had built. Suddenly, my beginner self was responsible for hosting hundreds of thousands of lab samples and supporting thousands of clients.</p>

					<p>Looking back, it shows exactly who I am: someone who jumps in before I can talk myself out of doing something that feels big or scary.</p>

					<h5>How I Learn</h5>
					<hr>
					<p>I learn best by starting with a finished product and pulling it apart piece by piece. My approach is to build quick, even messy, prototypes, break the code, and figure out why it works the way it does. For me, documentation serves as a reference, but hands-on experimentation is how I truly learn.</p>

					<h5>My Short Term Goals</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>After nearly two years of supporting the lab management system I built, I’m eager to take on new challenges and continue growing. I’ve started sharing my journey and lessons learned through my blog (SayHelloWorld.co) and YouTube channel, where I document projects and ideas.</p>
				<p>Beyond building small projects on my own, I’m looking for an opportunity to join a larger team — a place where I can contribute my skills, collaborate with others, and learn from more experienced developers.</p>
